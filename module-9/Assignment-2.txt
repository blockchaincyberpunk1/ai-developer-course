Open-Source Contribution in AI Development

Assignment Overview:
This assignment aims to provide students with hands-on experience in open-source AI development. Students will be tasked with finding an open-source AI project, contributing to it by addressing issues or adding valuable features, and sharing their experiences and learnings.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Find an Open-Source AI Project (1-2 hours)

Instruct students to search for an open-source AI project on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. The project should align with their interests and skill level.
Provide guidance on how to find and evaluate open-source projects, including factors like project activity, documentation quality, and issue tracking.
Task 2: Select a Contribution Task (2-3 hours)
3. Ask students to choose a specific task within the selected open-source AI project. Tasks can include:

Fixing a bug or issue.
Adding documentation or improving existing documentation.
Implementing a new feature or enhancement.
Ensure that the chosen task is appropriate for their skill level and aligns with their interests.
Task 3: Contribution and Documentation (4-5 hours)
5. Task students with actively contributing to the open-source project by:

Addressing the chosen issue or task.
Writing code or documentation following the project's guidelines.
Collaborating with the project maintainers and community.
Require students to document their contributions thoroughly, including code changes, discussions with project members, and any challenges faced.
Task 4: Submission and Reflection (2-3 hours)
7. Instruct students to submit their contributions to the open-source project, following the project's contribution guidelines (e.g., pull request submission on GitHub).

Ask them to write a reflective report on their experiences, detailing:
The nature of their contributions and the problem they solved.
Interactions and collaboration with project maintainers and contributors.
Challenges encountered during the contribution process and how they were overcome.
Key learnings and insights gained from the open-source contribution.
Task 5: Presentation (Optional, 2-3 hours)
9. Give students the option to present their experiences and contributions in a class presentation, sharing their insights with peers.

Grading Criteria:
Evaluation will be based on the following criteria:

The quality and impact of the contribution to the open-source AI project.
The completeness and clarity of documentation.
The depth and reflection in the reflective report.
The optional presentation quality (if chosen to present).
