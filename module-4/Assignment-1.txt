NLP Fundamentals and Text Preprocessing

Assignment Overview:
This assignment aims to introduce students to fundamental concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and hands-on text preprocessing techniques. Students will learn about tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and basic text preprocessing tasks to prepare text data for NLP applications.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to NLP (20 minutes)

Provide an introduction to the assignment, explaining that students will learn key NLP concepts and apply text preprocessing techniques to a dataset.
Task 2: NLP Concepts (1 hour)
2. Define and explain the following NLP concepts:

Tokenization: Breaking text into words or tokens.
Stemming: Reducing words to their root form by removing suffixes.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form.
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis, which includes tasks like removing special characters and converting text to lowercase.
Task 3: Text Dataset (30 minutes)
3. Provide a text dataset to students. You can create a sample dataset or use a publicly available one, ensuring it contains a variety of textual data.

Task 4: Tokenization and Basic Preprocessing (2 hours)
4. Instruct students to perform the following tasks on the provided text dataset:

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
Removing special characters: Eliminating punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters.
Removing stop words: Removing common words (e.g., "the," "and") that do not carry significant meaning.
Task 5: Data Analysis (1 hour)
5. Encourage students to analyze the tokenized and preprocessed data. They can calculate word frequencies, identify common words, and explore patterns in the text.

Task 6: Report or Presentation (2 - 3 hours)
6. Request students to create a report or presentation summarizing their understanding of NLP concepts, the steps they took in text preprocessing, and their analysis of the processed data.

Task 7: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
7. Ask students to submit their reports or presentation slides by the assigned deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct application of tokenization and text preprocessing techniques.
Quality of data analysis and insights gained.
Clarity and completeness of the report or presentation.
