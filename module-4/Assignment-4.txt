Language Translation with Transformer Models

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will be introduced to transformer architectures, which have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. They will focus on language translation and use transformer-based models to perform translation tasks on a multilingual dataset.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Transformers (30 minutes)

Provide an overview of transformer architectures, emphasizing their significance in NLP tasks. Explain the key components of transformers, such as self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding.
Task 2: Multilingual Dataset (20 minutes)
2. Provide a multilingual dataset containing text in different languages, along with their corresponding translations. Ensure that the dataset covers a variety of languages to give students exposure to diverse language pairs.

Task 3: Model Selection (1 hour)
3. Instruct students to choose a transformer-based model for the language translation task. They can select from pre-trained models like GPT-3, BERT, or T5, or implement their own transformer model using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Task 4: Data Preprocessing (1.5 hours)
4. Ask students to preprocess the dataset, including tokenization and data preparation for input to the chosen transformer model. Ensure that they handle both source and target languages appropriately.

Task 5: Model Training (2 hours)
5. Guide students in training their transformer-based model on the multilingual dataset. They should specify the loss function, optimization method, and evaluation metrics.

Task 6: Translation (1.5 hours)
6. Instruct students to use their trained model for language translation. Provide examples of sentences or phrases in one language and have students translate them into another language using their model.

Task 7: Evaluation (1.5 hours)
7. Ask students to evaluate the quality of the translations generated by their model. They should consider factors like fluency, accuracy, and coherence in the translated text.

Task 8: Analysis and Reflection (1 hour)
8. Encourage students to analyze their transformer model's performance and reflect on the challenges faced during the translation task. Discuss the impact of model selection on translation quality.

Task 9: Report or Presentation (2 - 3 hours)
9. Request students to create a report or presentation summarizing their language translation project. They should include details about data preprocessing, model selection, translation results, evaluation criteria, and insights gained.

Task 10: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
10. Ask students to submit their reports or presentation slides by the assigned deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation and fine-tuning of the chosen transformer-based model.
Quality of language translation and its evaluation.
Clarity and completeness of the report or presentation.
Depth of analysis and insights provided.
