Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

Assignment Overview:
This assignment focuses on sentiment analysis, where students will apply their knowledge of text vectorization and classification algorithms to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews. They will build a sentiment analysis model, evaluate its performance, and draw insights from the results.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Sentiment Analysis (20 minutes)

Provide an introduction to the assignment, explaining that students will perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral.
Task 2: Dataset (30 minutes)
2. Provide a dataset containing customer reviews. The dataset should include text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

Task 3: Data Preprocessing (1 hour)
3. Instruct students to perform data preprocessing tasks on the dataset:

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Converting text to lowercase for consistency.
Removing special characters and punctuation.
Removing stop words.
Text vectorization: Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Task 4: Model Building (2 hours)
4. Ask students to build a sentiment analysis model using classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines. They should split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Task 5: Model Evaluation (1.5 hours)
5. Instruct students to evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. They should report these metrics and provide a confusion matrix.

Task 6: Analysis and Insights (1.5 hours)
6. Encourage students to analyze the model's predictions and draw insights from the results. They should discuss any challenges they encountered and potential areas for model improvement.

Task 7: Report or Presentation (2 - 3 hours)
7. Request students to create a report or presentation summarizing their sentiment analysis project. They should include details about data preprocessing, model building, evaluation metrics, and insights gained.

Task 8: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
8. Ask students to submit their reports or presentation slides by the assigned deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct data preprocessing techniques.
Quality of the sentiment analysis model and its evaluation.
Clarity and completeness of the report or presentation.
Depth of analysis and insights provided.
