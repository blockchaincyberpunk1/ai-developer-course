Building a Machine Learning Model with scikit-learn

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience with building and evaluating machine learning models using the scikit-learn library, a popular tool for machine learning in Python. They will be provided with a dataset suitable for classification or regression and tasked with selecting an appropriate algorithm, building a model, and assessing its performance. This assignment aims to strengthen students' practical skills in machine learning and model evaluation.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction and Dataset Overview (1 hour)

Provide students with an overview of the assignment's objectives and structure.
Introduce scikit-learn as a powerful machine learning library in Python.
Present the dataset for this assignment, including a description of its features and the prediction task (classification or regression).
Task 2: Data Preprocessing (2 hours)
4. Instruct students to load the dataset using scikit-learn and perform necessary data preprocessing tasks, including:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical features (if applicable).
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Scaling or normalizing features (if needed).
Students should document their data preprocessing steps and explain why each step is necessary.
Task 3: Model Selection and Building (4 hours)
6. Task students with choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm from scikit-learn for the given dataset and prediction task (classification or regression). They should consider factors like data type, problem complexity, and the nature of the prediction.

Instruct students to build the machine learning model using the selected algorithm and the training dataset. They should set hyperparameters and document their choices.
Encourage students to provide code comments to explain the model-building process.
Task 4: Model Evaluation (4 hours)
9. Ask students to evaluate the performance of their machine learning model using appropriate evaluation metrics. For classification tasks, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score may be relevant. For regression tasks, metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared may be suitable.

Students should generate predictions on the test dataset and calculate the chosen evaluation metrics. They should interpret the results and discuss the model's performance in their documentation.
Task 5: Documentation and Interpretation (2 hours)
11. Task students with documenting their entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter choices, and evaluation.

Encourage students to provide interpretations of their findings. They should discuss the strengths and limitations of their chosen model and suggest potential improvements.
Task 6: Submission (15 minutes)
13. Set a submission deadline for the assignment. Students should submit their documented code and analysis by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Completeness and correctness of data preprocessing.
Appropriateness of the chosen machine learning algorithm.
Quality of model building and parameter tuning.
Accuracy and clarity of model evaluation and interpretation.
Overall organization and documentation of the workflow.
