Text Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Assignment Overview:
This assignment introduces students to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their application in text generation tasks. Students will build an RNN-based model to generate text sequences and evaluate the quality of the generated text.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to RNNs (30 minutes)

Provide an introduction to the assignment, explaining that students will learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their role in processing sequential data, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Task 2: Dataset (20 minutes)
2. Provide a dataset containing a collection of text sequences, such as sentences or paragraphs. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and relevant to the chosen text generation task.

Task 3: RNN Model Building (2 hours)
3. Instruct students to build an RNN-based text generation model using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. They should consider the following steps:

Data preprocessing: Tokenize and vectorize the text data.
Design the RNN architecture: Choose the type of RNN cell (e.g., LSTM or GRU) and define the model architecture.
Training the model: Train the RNN on the dataset, specifying the loss function and optimization method.
Text generation: Generate text sequences using the trained RNN model.
Task 4: Text Generation (1.5 hours)
4. Ask students to use their trained RNN model to generate text sequences. They should experiment with different starting phrases or words to observe the model's creativity and coherence in generating text.

Task 5: Evaluation (1.5 hours)
5. Instruct students to evaluate the quality of the generated text. They should consider factors like fluency, coherence, and relevance to the given dataset. Encourage them to provide examples of both successful and less successful text generation.

Task 6: Analysis and Reflection (1 hour)
6. Encourage students to analyze their RNN model's performance and reflect on the challenges faced during the text generation task. They should also discuss potential use cases for text generation in NLP.

Task 7: Report or Presentation (2 - 3 hours)
7. Request students to create a report or presentation summarizing their RNN-based text generation project. They should include details about data preprocessing, model architecture, text generation results, evaluation criteria, and insights gained.

Task 8: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
8. Ask students to submit their reports or presentation slides by the assigned deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the RNN-based text generation model.
Quality of the generated text and its evaluation.
Clarity and completeness of the report or presentation.
Depth of analysis and insights provided.
