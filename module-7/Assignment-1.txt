Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will dive into the fundamentals of reinforcement learning (RL). They will research and provide a comprehensive explanation of key RL concepts, including Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Q-learning. To enhance their understanding, students will create flowcharts or diagrams illustrating the key components of an RL problem. Additionally, they should explore and provide examples of real-world applications where reinforcement learning can be effectively applied.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (1 hour)

Provide students with an introductory overview of reinforcement learning, emphasizing its role in training agents to make sequential decisions.
Explain the distinction between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Task 2: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) (2 hours)
3. Instruct students to research and provide a detailed explanation of Markov decision processes (MDPs).

Emphasize the essential components of an MDP, including states, actions, rewards, transition probabilities, and the Markov property.
Encourage students to use diagrams or flowcharts to visualize the structure of an MDP.
Task 3: Q-Learning (2 hours)
6. Explain the concept of Q-learning as a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm.

Describe how Q-learning is used to estimate the value of taking specific actions in an MDP.
Provide a step-by-step explanation of the Q-learning algorithm.
Encourage students to include pseudocode or simple code snippets to illustrate the Q-learning process.
Task 4: Flowcharts or Diagrams (3-4 hours)
10. Task students with creating flowcharts or diagrams that illustrate the key components of an RL problem. These diagrams should encompass states, actions, rewards, transitions, and the agent's decision-making process.

Ensure that the flowcharts or diagrams are clear and visually represent the flow of an RL problem.
Task 5: Real-World Applications (2 hours)
12. Ask students to research and identify real-world applications where reinforcement learning has been successfully applied. Examples may include robotics, game playing, autonomous vehicles, and recommendation systems.

Encourage them to provide brief explanations of how RL is used in these applications and its impact.
Task 6: Presentation (15-20 minutes)
14. Instruct students to prepare a brief presentation summarizing their findings on RL fundamentals, MDPs, Q-learning, and real-world applications.

Allow time for questions and discussions following the presentations.
Task 7: Submission (15 minutes)
16. Set a submission deadline for the assignment. Students should submit their reports, diagrams, and presentation slides by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and depth of explanations for RL concepts, MDPs, and Q-learning.
Quality and relevance of flowcharts or diagrams.
Identification and explanation of real-world RL applications.
Quality of the presentation and ability to effectively communicate the concepts.
