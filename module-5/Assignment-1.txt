Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will dive into the world of data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib, two powerful libraries in Python. They will be provided with a dataset and tasked with performing basic data manipulation, exploring the dataset's characteristics, and visualizing key insights.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Dataset Loading (15 minutes)

Provide students with a dataset in a common data format (e.g., CSV, Excel) along with a brief description of its content and structure.
Instruct students to import the dataset using Pandas and load it into a DataFrame.
Task 2: Data Exploration (1 hour)
3. Assign students various data exploration tasks, including:

Displaying basic statistics (mean, median, etc.) of numeric columns.
Checking for missing values and handling them if necessary.
Filtering rows based on specific conditions.
Selecting and displaying specific columns of interest.
Task 3: Data Visualization (1.5 hours)
4. Ask students to create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib to gain insights from the dataset. Possible visualizations may include:

Bar charts to show the distribution of categorical variables.
Histograms or density plots to visualize the distribution of numeric data.
Scatter plots for examining relationships between two numeric variables.
Box plots to identify outliers in the data.
Task 4: Interpretation and Analysis (1 hour)
5. Require students to provide interpretations and insights from their data exploration and visualizations. They should discuss any trends, patterns, or anomalies they observe in the dataset.

Task 5: Presentation or Report (1.5 - 2 hours)
6. Ask students to compile their findings and insights into a presentation or report. This should include descriptions of data preprocessing, exploratory tasks, visualizations, and their interpretations.

Task 6: Submission (15 minutes)
7. Set a submission deadline for the assignment. Students should submit their reports or presentation files by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct loading and manipulation of the dataset using Pandas.
Quality and relevance of data exploration tasks performed.
Effectiveness of data visualization techniques used.
Clarity and depth of insights provided in the interpretation and analysis.
Presentation or report quality, including organization and visual appeal.
