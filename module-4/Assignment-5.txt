Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling for Text Summarization

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will explore the concept of sequence-to-sequence modeling, a fundamental technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They will focus on text summarization, a real-world application of sequence-to-sequence models, and build a model to automatically generate summaries for given text inputs.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Introduction to Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling (30 minutes)

Provide an overview of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, explaining their architecture, components (encoder and decoder), and applications in NLP, such as machine translation, chatbots, and text summarization.
Task 2: Text Summarization Dataset (20 minutes)
2. Provide a dataset containing text documents and their corresponding human-generated summaries. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and includes documents from various domains.

Task 3: Model Selection (1 hour)
3. Instruct students to choose a sequence-to-sequence model architecture for the text summarization task. They can opt for models like LSTM-based Seq2Seq, Attention-based Seq2Seq, or transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).

Task 4: Data Preprocessing (1.5 hours)
4. Ask students to preprocess the dataset, including tokenization, padding sequences, and data preparation for input to the chosen sequence-to-sequence model. Ensure that they handle both source text and target summaries appropriately.

Task 5: Model Design and Training (2 hours)
5. Guide students in designing and training their sequence-to-sequence model. They should set up the encoder-decoder architecture, specify the loss function, optimization method, and evaluation metrics.

Task 6: Summarization (1.5 hours)
6. Instruct students to use their trained model to generate summaries for a set of text documents. Provide a test dataset with documents for this purpose.

Task 7: Evaluation (1.5 hours)
7. Ask students to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries using metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). Encourage them to analyze the results and discuss potential improvements.

Task 8: Analysis and Reflection (1 hour)
8. Encourage students to analyze their sequence-to-sequence model's performance and reflect on the challenges faced during the text summarization task. Discuss the impact of model architecture and data preprocessing on summary quality.

Task 9: Report or Presentation (2 - 3 hours)
9. Request students to create a report or presentation summarizing their text summarization project. They should include details about data preprocessing, model selection, summarization results, evaluation criteria, and insights gained.

Task 10: Submission (30 minutes - 1 hour)
10. Ask students to submit their reports or presentation slides by the assigned deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation and fine-tuning of the chosen sequence-to-sequence model.
Quality of text summarization and its evaluation using appropriate metrics.
Clarity and completeness of the report or presentation.
Depth of analysis and insights provided.
