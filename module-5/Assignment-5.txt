EDA Report

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will work with a complex dataset from a specific domain (e.g., finance, healthcare) and perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). They will use Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. The goal is to provide insights into the dataset's characteristics, uncover patterns, and discuss potential real-world applications based on their analysis.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Dataset Introduction (15 minutes)

Provide students with a complex dataset related to a specific domain. Ensure that the dataset contains a variety of variables and data points, making it suitable for a comprehensive analysis.
Encourage students to provide a brief introduction to the dataset, including its source, context, and the key variables it contains.
Task 2: Data Exploration (2 hours)
3. Instruct students to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform data exploration, which includes:

Displaying summary statistics for numeric variables.
Identifying data types, including categorical and numerical features.
Detecting and handling any missing values.
Creating initial visualizations to understand the distribution of variables.
Task 3: In-Depth Analysis (4 hours)
4. Challenge students to perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset. They should:

Identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data using advanced visualization techniques with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Explore relationships between variables through correlation analysis.
Conduct subgroup analyses if applicable (e.g., by segmenting data based on categorical variables).
Formulate hypotheses about the dataset's characteristics and potential real-world applications.
Task 4: Insights and Applications (3 hours)
5. Ask students to provide detailed insights based on their analysis. They should discuss what they have learned about the dataset, any actionable information it provides, and its potential real-world applications.

Encourage critical thinking and the exploration of different use cases or scenarios where the dataset's insights could be valuable.
Task 5: EDA Report (3 hours)
7. Require students to compile their findings and analysis into a formal report. The report should be well-structured, including sections for introduction, data exploration, in-depth analysis, insights, and potential applications.

Specify the format for submission, whether it's a written report or another appropriate format.
Task 6: Submission (15 minutes)
9. Set a submission deadline for the assignment. Students should submit their EDA reports by the specified deadline.

Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:

Quality and depth of data exploration and analysis.
Clarity and depth of insights into the dataset.
Thoughtfulness in discussing potential real-world applications.
Overall structure and presentation of the EDA report.
