Robot Navigation with RL

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to a simulated robot navigation task. They will be tasked with training a virtual robot to navigate from a starting point to a goal while avoiding obstacles in a 2D or 3D environment. The assignment will require students to implement RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks), document their approach, and report their results, including any challenges faced during training.

Assignment Instructions:

Task 1: Environment Setup (1-2 hours)

Provide students with access to a simulated robot navigation environment (you can use existing RL environments or tools like OpenAI Gym, Unity ML-Agents, or custom-made simulators).
Ensure the environment includes a 2D or 3D grid, a robot agent, a goal location, and obstacles that the robot must avoid.
Task 2: RL Algorithm Selection (1-2 hours)
3. Instruct students to choose an RL algorithm suitable for solving the robot navigation task. They can select from algorithms such as Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or variants of these algorithms.

Ask them to justify their choice of algorithm based on the task's complexity and requirements.
Task 3: Implementation (4-6 hours)
5. Task students with implementing the selected RL algorithm to train the robot.

They should write code to define the robot's state and action spaces, create the Q-table or neural network model, and implement the learning algorithm.
Instruct them to document their code and include comments explaining key components.
Task 4: Training and Optimization (4-6 hours)
8. Have students run multiple training episodes to train the robot in the environment.

Encourage them to fine-tune hyperparameters, such as learning rates and exploration strategies, to optimize training performance.
Instruct students to track training progress, including changes in the Q-values (if applicable) and the robot's navigation behavior.
Task 5: Results and Challenges (2-3 hours)
11. Ask students to report the results of their RL training, including the success rate of navigation, time taken to reach the goal, and any observed issues or challenges.

Have them document any modifications or adjustments made during training to improve performance.
Task 6: Conclusion and Reflection (1-2 hours)
13. Instruct students to write a conclusion that summarizes their findings and reflects on the effectiveness of RL in solving the robot navigation task.

Encourage them to discuss potential real-world applications of RL-based robot navigation.
Grading Criteria:
The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the selected RL algorithm.
Quality of code documentation and comments.
Successful training of the robot in the simulated environment.
Reporting of training results, including challenges and optimizations.
Thoughtful reflection on the application of RL in robot navigation.
